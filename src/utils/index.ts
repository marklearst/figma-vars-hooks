 * @summary
 * Provides centralized exports of utility functions for manipulating and querying Figma variables and design tokens.

 * Import from this barrel for consistent and type-safe access to these helpers.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { filterVariables } from '@figma-vars/hooks/utils';
 *
 * const filtered = filterVariables(allVariables, { resolvedType: 'COLOR' });
 * ```
 *
